       <p>Regular exercise has been proven to have a positive impact on mental health. Physical activity can help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, improve mood, and boost overall mental well-being.</p>

  <li><strong>Improved Sleep</strong>: Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and deepen your sleep.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduction of Stress</strong>: Exercise reduces levels of the body's stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol.</li>
